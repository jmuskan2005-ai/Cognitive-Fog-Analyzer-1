# Cognitive-Fog-Analyzer-1
An on terminal running tool that helps you understand your daily mental clarity. You just enter how you slept, how focused you felt, your stress, and screen time — and it gives you a simple “fog score.” Everything gets saved automatically so you can look back later and see what’s really affecting your mind.
