# Problem Statement:
- Many people experience mental “fog” but rarely track the daily habits that cause it.
- Without regular logging, it’s hard to understand how sleep, focus, stress, or screen time affect mental clarity.
- There is no simple, lightweight tool that helps users record this information quickly without complicated interfaces.
- The challenge is to create a fast, human-friendly way to measure and monitor daily cognitive clarity.

# Scope of the Project:
- Build a terminal-based tool that collects daily mental-health related inputs.
- Calculate a cognitive fog score using simple weighted logic.
- Store each day’s entry in a CSV file automatically.
- Provide summary insights like average fog score, best/worst days, and trends.
- The project focuses only on tracking and analysis, not medical diagnosis.

# Target Users:
- Students who want to understand how study patterns affect their clarity.
- Working professionals managing stress, screen time, or focus.
- Individuals tracking their wellness and daily habits.
- Anyone who prefers a simple terminal-based tool over heavy apps.
- Users who want lightweight mental-clarity tracking without sharing data online.

# High Level Features:
- Terminal input system for daily logs (sleep, focus, stress, screen time).
- Automatic cognitive fog score calculation.
- CSV-based storage for long-term history.
- Summary reports: average score, best/worst days, total entries.
- Human-friendly messages and clean terminal output.
- Works on any system with Python — no extra setup.
- Modular code design for easy updates or feature expansion.
